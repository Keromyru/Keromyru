Hi, I’m Aurora (@Keromyru), I have been working as a Web Dev but also trying to familiarize myself with Game Dev via in school projects and personal projects.

I’m interested in learning more about Web Dev as I have experience and enjoy the problem space; in particular full stack web developement as I have been primarily focused on front end-development, integrations and utilizing APIs. I also have some familiarity with AWS SAM and Lambdas.

Recently I have been working on:
- Creating a gh-pages site to showcase my resume, detailed write ups and reflections on projects (I have several reflections, good and bad @\_\@), as well as being able to experience with some front end features I never got to tackle in a work environment. Also I can be as verbose and detailed as I want :) 
- Creating the foundation for a tactical RPG game; I have code named it LoveLetter as I want it to be a love letter to games like _Shining Force 2_ and _Fire Emblem_. In particular having a large group of characters to control (12 in SF2!), interesting decisions with promotions from one class to another, well crafted battle scenarios with fun twists (the Kraken fight anyone? Taros? Chess battle? Geshp with the prism flowers? Odd Eye? So many great examples) and if I remain super passionate, a great story! It is a lot but can definitely be something i've been thinking about and working on to even just learn the Unity Engine!

In the past I have worked on two game projects...
The first was an overall excellent experience:

We worked so well together and learned a lot; we also easily divvied up the tasks we needed to complete with everyone being able to work on stuff they were really passionate about. I was the Team Lead for the group. I managed the team, help teach some of my peers how to use git in a collaborative setting, assisted in ensuring everyone had support and if they got stuck help them directly or lead them to @Oliver-Akins who was our technical lead. I was also passionate about the gameplay design and how to make it really fun; this was my major contribution to the code. I ended up implementing stats, weapons and skill upgrades. I had a blast figuring out how to implement them all and ensuring the gameplay was enjoyable and fun!  

The second was, if i am being frank, very rough. It was for CMPT 406 and our team struggled. I was really gun-ho about ensuring everyone understood git in a team setting (i've heard stories of duplicating the whole file system of a Unity project O\_O, that sounded horrible) and I also knew that git can be confusing to use as a team, especially for first timers, so I wrote up a document with some basics like how to setup SSH keys, some useful commands and quality of life stuff, link to the [project wiki with my git guide](https://github.com/Keromyru/CMPT-406-Combat-Farming-Game/wiki/General-Git-guide). I was pretty proud of it at the time and hopeful all my teamamtes could learn! I was also pushing myself out of my comfort zone and wanted to handle the role of Techincal Lead which was a good experience to have, even if it was filled with hard lessons. Which there was a lot of hard lessions and difficulties. I will do a full write up of my reflections and where development went awry once I get the GH pages site more fleshed out.

Anyhoo, if you want to collab let me know! My schedule might get busy but I will definitely make room if I can!
